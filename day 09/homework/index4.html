         <p>Halloween is celebrated on October 31st and has roots in ancient Celtic traditions,<br> particularly the festival of Samhain. During Samhain, people believed the boundary between <br> the living and the dead blurred, and they lit <br> bonfires and wore costumes to ward off spirits. Over time, <br> Halloween evolved into a day of fun activities like trick-or-treating, carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns, <br> and dressing up in spooky or creative costumes.</p><br>
